# About Dataset:
Request id: A unique identifier of the request

Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request

Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed

Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made

Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver

Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available
# Required Analysis
1.Which date had the most completed trip durig the two week period?
2.What was the highest no. of completed trips within a 24 hour period?
3.What was the highest no. of completed trips within a 24 hour period of a driver?
4.Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two week period?
5.What is the day with the highest number of requests in the dataset?
6.What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred?
7.What percentage of the total requests were either cancelled or put on hold due to unavailability of cabs?
8.During which time of the day did the majority of the requests occur? Was it during early morning, morning, afternoon, evening, or late night?

# Methodology
Define the problem or objective of the case study, such as analyzing Uber's business model or identifying growth strategies.

Gather relevant data on Uber's history, market performance, and industry landscape.

Apply analytical frameworks like SWOT analysis or Porter's Five Forces to evaluate Uber's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Compare Uber's performance with competitors and industry benchmarks.

Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis to address the identified problem or objective.

Develop an implementation plan and evaluate the potential outcomes and implications of the recommendations.

# Conclusion
The analysis of the data reveals some interesting insights:

1.High Activity on September 22, 2012: The date 2012-09-22 stands out with a significantly high number of completed trips, reaching a total of 248. This indicates a substantial level of activity and demand on that particular day. Several factors such as events, promotions, or increased demand for transportation services could contribute to the high number of completed trips on this date.

2.Peak Demand at 11 PM: During the two-week period, the hour with the highest demand and completed trips was 11 PM, recording a total of 134 trips. This specific time period experienced a notable surge in activity and usage, indicating a peak demand for transportation services. It suggests the need for increased driver availability during this time to efficiently handle customer requests.

3.Peak Hour for Ride Requests at 11 PM: Similarly, during the two-week period, the hour with the highest number of requests was 11 PM, with a total of 184 requests. This hour witnessed a substantial increase in demand, indicating it as a peak hour for ride requests. This information emphasizes the significance of this hour as a busy period for the service provider and the importance of ensuring adequate driver availability.

4.Weighted Average Calculation: The weighted average of completed trips based on unique drivers is calculated as 7.1319261213720315. This metric provides an understanding of the average number of completed trips per unique driver, taking into account the varying number of drivers for different periods.

The analysis further highlights the potential of identifying the busiest 8-hour period, which can aid in scheduling driver shifts and ensuring optimal coverage during peak demand. By allocating resources effectively during this period, the service provider can meet the high customer demand and enhance the overall experience for riders.

It's important to note that the relationship between driver supply and demand is not always directly proportional. Various factors and circumstances can influence the availability of drivers, such as driver availability, scheduling constraints, and market dynamics. Effective management and planning are essential to align driver supply with demand fluctuations and ensure optimal service delivery.

Regarding the statement "df.loc[216:216+71] This is the 72-hour period where the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs is the highest," it appears to refer to a specific analysis or calculation involving the DataFrame df within the specified range. However, the exact meaning of "Zeroes to Eyeballs" and the specific analysis being referenced is unclear without further context or explanation.

To provide a refined presentation for your project, it's recommended to incorporate clear and concise language that accurately conveys the insights gained from the data analysis. Use visual aids such as graphs or charts to support your findings and present them in an easily understandable manner. Additionally, consider providing relevant context and implications of the analysis to give a comprehensive understanding of the data and its significance for decision-making.

# Recommendation for Business
The data analysis provides insights for Uber's business:

1.Identify high activity days to understand increased demand factors.
2.Address peak demand hours, like 11 PM, by ensuring driver availability.
3.Calculate weighted average of completed trips per unique driver for performance evaluation.
4.Optimize driver shifts during the busiest 8-hour period to maximize coverage.
5.Recognize the complex relationship between supply and demand.
These insights help Uber improve customer satisfaction, resource allocation, and competitive advantage.
